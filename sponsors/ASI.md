**Agent Communication Protocol**:
```javascript
// Real-time agent interaction example
const agentInteraction = {
    task: "milestone_verification",
    agents: [
        "EvidenceAnalyzer",
        "AuthenticityChecker",
        "ComplianceValidator",
        "RiskAssessor"
    ],
    context: {

        evidenceAnalysis: evidenceResults,
        blockchainContext: realtimeBlockchainData,
        marketContext: currentMarketConditions,
        contributorContext: contributorBehaviorAnalysis
    },
    consensus: {
        requiredConfidence: 0.8,
        maxProcessingTime: 120000, // 2 minutes
        fallbackMechanism: "human_review"
    }
};
```

    evidenceScore: 0.4 * (
        evidenceAnalysis.relevance * 0.4 +
        evidenceAnalysis.completeness * 0.3 +
        evidenceAnalysis.authenticity * 0.3
    ),
    agentScore: 0.6 * (
        agentVerdict.confidence * 0.7 +
        agentConsensus * 0.3
    ),
    riskAdjustment: calculateRiskAdjustment(realtimeRiskAssessment),
    finalConfidence: evidenceScore + agentScore + riskAdjustment
};
```

**Verdict Generation Logic**:
```javascript
function generateVerdict(confidence, risk, context) {
    if (confidence >= 0.8 && risk.overall < 0.3) {
        return {
            verdict: 'approved',
            action: 'auto_release_funds',
            reasoning: 'High confidence, low risk - automatic approval'
        };
    } else if (confidence >= 0.6 && risk.overall < 0.5) {
        return {
            verdict: 'uncertain',
            action: 'human_review',
            reasoning: 'Moderate confidence - requires human oversight'
        };
    } else {
        return {
            verdict: 'rejected',
            action: 'request_revision',
            reasoning: 'Low confidence or high risk - milestone needs improvement'
        };
    }
}
```

#### **6. Real-time Context Integration**

**Live Data Sources**:

```javascript
const realtimeContext = {
    marketConditions: {
        btcPrice: 45000,
        btcChange24h: -2.5,
        ethPrice: 2800,
        ethChange24h: -1.8,
        pyusdPeg: 1.0002, // Slight depegging
        volatilityIndex: 0.65 // High volatility
    },
    contributorBehavior: {
        totalContributors: 156,
        avgContribution: 250,
        concentrationRatio: 0.3, // 30% from top 10 contributors
        newContributors: 23,
        riskScore: 0.25
    },
    verificationPatterns: {
        recentApprovalRate: 0.78,
        avgProcessingTime: 95000, // 95 seconds
        confidenceTrend: 'stable',
        accuracyRate: 0.92
    }
};
```

#### **7. Blockchain Integration & Fund Release**

**Smart Contract Interaction**:
```solidity
// AI verdict submission to blockchain
function onAiVerdict(uint256 _milestoneId, uint8 _verdict) external {
    require(msg.sender == aiHandler, "Only AI handler");
    require(_milestoneId < campaignInfo.milestoneCount, "Invalid milestone");

    Milestone storage m = milestones[_milestoneId];
    require(m.state == MilestoneState.Submitted, "Milestone not submitted");

    emit MilestoneVerified(_milestoneId, _verdict);

    if (_verdict == 1) { // Approved
        _payoutMilestone(_milestoneId); // Release funds to creator
    } else {
        m.state = MilestoneState.Rejected; // Mark for revision
    }
}
```

**Automatic Fund Release Process**:
1. AI submits verdict to smart contract via `onAiVerdict()`
2. Contract validates AI handler authorization
3. If approved, `_payoutMilestone()` transfers funds to creator
4. Event `FundsReleased` logged for transparency
5. Real-time notifications sent to all stakeholders

#### **8. Continuous Learning & Improvement**

**Model Training Pipeline**:
- **Ground Truth Collection**: Human-reviewed decisions for training
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of successful verification patterns
- **Bias Detection**: Regular fairness and bias audits
- **Performance Optimization**: A/B testing of verification algorithms

**Feedback Loop Integration**:
```javascript
// Continuous learning from verification outcomes
const learningData = {
    milestoneId: verifiedMilestone.id,
    aiVerdict: verificationResult.verdict,
    humanReview: humanDecision.finalVerdict,
    outcome: actualSuccess, // Whether milestone was truly completed
    context: realtimeContext,
    timestamp: Date.now()
};

await asiClient.submitLearningData(learningData);
```
